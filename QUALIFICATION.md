# Numerical qualification

Dated evidence for the changes below, not a claim that a moving branch or a
new device/cohort is qualified. See [README.md](README.md) for current usage.

## Whole-fit ownership and certificate consolidation — 2026-09-09

Reference: `72f76a8c2ab3066ab1df01b5288d303e73e2f8d0`; version remains `0.5.0`.
The final tested inference-source fingerprint is
`2c0af4df27314b582dd71601324d8c3ec64d7dfc7d17b5173af2293800593ee1`.
The frozen reference archive SHA-256 is
`85dde34f48086c56a63920a9e22c3ef243b9694eecda6e42d79f9cdd0856e70c`.

The reported ownership issue is real: replacing only `RawFit.state` leaves
its separate `certificate.witness` on the original device. The replacement
`offload_raw_fit_to_cpu` moves both, including dense/compressed witnesses,
warm-state certificate hints, and witness-only fits with no state. One tensor
memo reuses transfers for identical views across all those owners. Values,
dtype, graph/scope evidence, diagnostics, and recorded solve device are
preserved. Guided initialization moves its two final state tensors to CPU at
construction, so no second generic state-only offloader remains.

Terminal certification adds work counters immediately instead of keeping
every refinement result. It also releases the temporary edge-dual alias after
computing the next generalized-gradient adjustment. The four-pass limit,
optional fifth pass, gradient reconciliation, and final audit are unchanged.
A pinned, instrumented terminal-loop test observes previous live witness
counts **[0,1,2,3,4] → [0,1,1,1,1]** while retaining all five passes and the
same summed work count of 15. The float32 variant additionally checks that
only the final witness survives when the float64 audit begins. These tests
mock certificate results inside actual solver orchestration; they are not
end-to-end GPU memory measurements.

One dual-refinement driver replaces the vectorized and streamed drivers.
Each iteration freezes the complete adjoint/residual before updating any
chunk. Incoming/analytic comparison, strict best-witness updates, ties,
projection, plateau rules, status strings, and work accounting are preserved.
The one-chunk route still uses the existing full graph-adjoint implementation;
the streamed update still uses its original bounded scatter accumulation.
No new forced-streaming CUDA reduction route is introduced. Full-graph audit
routes, including their existing deterministic complete-graph path, remain
unchanged.

Numerical routines now exchange `KKTDiagnostics` directly. Obsolete mapping
conversions and unused residual-copy/cache blocks are deleted; legacy progress
residuals remain distinct from terminal componentwise backward errors.
`RawAttemptTrace` composes the existing frozen, tensor-free `ConvergenceResult`
and derives its aggregate KKT residual. Established failure-message fields and
tokens remain exact, without reintroducing a witness-owning certificate record.

The NumPy evaluator has one private emission/reduction path for loss-only,
posterior-only, and full-derivative work. CEM keeps its existing center loop;
reporting keeps the same marginalized conditional posterior and MAP tie rule.
Internal emission/candidate names replace retired path terminology without
compatibility aliases. Legitimate lambda-path names and public refit
provenance strings are deliberately unchanged.

Validation in `ml1`: **637 tests passed, 6 CUDA-only tests skipped**; Ruff and
`git diff --check` pass. The suite includes isolated wheel installation and
CPU fits, independent simultaneous-update calculations, nonfinite/fail-closed
diagnostics, both witness representations, alias preservation, stateless fits,
and recovery/bracket continuation tests. Pinned fixed-environment CPU captures
are byte-identical, with final-source fingerprints checked before and after
each capture:

| Capture | Coverage | Matching SHA-256 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Certificate refinement | 36 cases: both dtypes/chunk modes, incoming/analytic/refined witnesses, complete residual sequences and statuses | `02b4f85153360dd5cc96d2cb295961b3f6187e0065759737739480d25eab8a57` |
| Inner solves | 24 ALM/PDHG cases: dense/streamed, zero/positive lambda, legacy/componentwise stopping, values and work counts | `cd28ff64a9ed5bfb6ec5703241435f565fd0d4ca4e5f9d9c80de18a254ab572e` |
| Host reductions | 2,424 numerical leaves: full terms, center costs, CEM decisions, conditional probabilities and MAP calls | `bf4094d42e22e239a859ab31c1a7d8406b4ffc832d318b002f713dfc656b7038` |
| Raw/warm and hybrid | 17,900 numerical leaves: objective/graph identities, basins, certificates, scores and uncertainty | `4041b281a0e16ddbb3405e6a11d367d5080ebdf21b40b68527d39fe56ab96bbd` |
| Proposal pools | 3,432 numerical leaves: ambiguous multi-region pilot/final-Phi pools, labels, refits and ordering | `a2447cfe2b7d2d43318f490cf32d9166e84e67bafc539ac83e2e25b937fffe72` |
| CNA-positive hybrid | 566 numerical leaves: public refits, posteriors, CNA-only F1, qualification and four TSVs | `52e3bf8dfcf8e1431d45dac757e890d5484ef6ddf7ed332d34d95503082dc7e4` |

For a 256-mutation, 3-region, 6-candidate host fixture, instrumented derivative
arrays decrease **3 arrays / 110,592 bytes → zero** per loss/posterior call.
Three center evaluations avoid 331,776 aggregate derivative-array bytes. Full
derivative evaluation is unchanged. This measures selected array allocations,
not total peak memory, RSS, latency, or production VRAM. Small-fixture F1
parity likewise is not a cohort-accuracy claim; the CNA checks retain exact
`major_cn != minor_cn` eligibility and public refitted CCFs.

Inference source remains **34 modules**, decreasing **725,861 → 713,768 bytes**
(12,093 fewer bytes; 1.67%). Tests and qualification evidence remain in the
repository. No likelihood, graph, fusion norm, score, candidate family, global
optimality safeguard, output schema, or balanced `0.004` admission gate changed.

CUDA and representative release/cohort qualification are still pending. No
remote jobs were launched. Six tests are explicitly gated by
`CLIPP2_TEST_CUDA=1` for execution only inside an approved, commit-pinned
Seadragon LSF allocation: persistent dense/compressed history, witness-only
fits, and one-/multi-chunk adjoint routing. The `clipp2-run` workflow requires
an immutable committed source and the external LSF project runbook, which is
currently absent. CPU results do not qualify CUDA behavior or GPU memory use.

## Deletion-first compaction — 2026-09-09

Reference: `bb726ad3fb3737cca48e06cce66943d5fbba52b4`; version remains `0.5.0`.
The tested inference-source fingerprint is
`efe7f40e2912f516f12f5418a064557796a5925766325d85f11eab6ee755cd76`.
This pass completes the precision/memory contraction below without changing
the integer likelihood, graph, fusion penalty, hybrid candidate families,
Dirichlet score (`alpha=1`, weight `0.7`), KKT gate, or output meanings.

Production proposals now have one host CEM/refit implementation; Torch still
computes curvature and Ward labels. The alternate Torch refit/CEM branch,
fixed-policy switches, redundant rescoring, and duplicate best-refit tracking
are deleted. Leave-one-out allocation costs, empty-cluster repair, strict score
improvement, refit caching, both candidate families, ordering, and deduplication
are preserved. Shared constants now live in `config.py`, conditional integer
posteriors in `core/objective.py`, and initializer orchestration in
`core/fusion/partition_starts.py`. Their three former modules have no
compatibility shells. Lazy public imports retain their names and identities.

Search traces contain immutable diagnostics, not fits, primals, solver states,
or certificate witnesses. Start comparison retains its stable ordering and
tie rules. Same-lambda recovery retains precisely the minimum finite-KKT
state previously selected from the complete attempt list; actual selected
history and bracket states remain available. Failure diagnostics use typed
fields; the duplicate diagnostic class and obsolete-object fallbacks are gone.
The prepared problem derives epsilon from its immutable objective key.

Validation in `ml1`: **545 tests passed**, including the independently installed
wheel and its minimal runnable example; Ruff and `git diff --check` pass.
The wheel contains only that minimal example, while the larger example,
simulator, and regression evidence remain in the repository. Tests cover
retired interfaces, host-CEM statistical invariants, exact pinned failure
diagnostic fields/tokens, streaming ties and nonfinite comparisons, and
state release across actual search recovery/bracket orchestration.

Fresh fixed-environment CPU captures match the pinned reference byte-for-byte
in both float32 and float64:

| Capture | Coverage | Matching SHA-256 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Proposal pools | Ambiguous CN2/3/6, 8 mutations, 2 regions; pilot and final-Phi Ward/CEM labels, refits, ordering, scores and selection | `a2447cfe2b7d2d43318f490cf32d9166e84e67bafc539ac83e2e25b937fffe72` |
| Raw/warm and hybrid | Ten raw/warm cases and two hybrid fits; 17,900 numerical leaves | `4041b281a0e16ddbb3405e6a11d367d5080ebdf21b40b68527d39fe56ab96bbd` |
| CNA-positive hybrid | Four fits; public labels/refit CCFs, score uncertainty, posteriors, CNA-only F1, qualification and four TSVs | `52e3bf8dfcf8e1431d45dac757e890d5484ef6ddf7ed332d34d95503082dc7e4` |

Proposal captures contain nine pilot candidates in each dtype, nine final-Phi
candidates in float32, and ten in float64; both Ward and distinct Ward+CEM
partitions are exercised. CNA-positive fits each contain eight positive-depth
`major_cn != minor_cn` rows. These small fixtures establish parity, not cohort
accuracy or a new F1 performance estimate. Graph/objective identities, selected
basins, certificates, and reporting remain equal in the paired captures.

A larger state-lifetime probe uses real `fit_prepared` orchestration with a
mocked numerical solve: 256 mutations, 3 regions, 32,640 complete-graph edges,
and 783,360 bytes per unique float64 dual buffer shared by state and witness.
At 4/12/32 starts, the reference retains 4/12/32 such buffers at peak; the new
low-level fit and isolated diagnostic-projection probes each peak at two
(incumbent plus current), with one winner remaining afterward. At 32 starts
this is **25,067,520 → 1,566,720 bytes**, a 93.75% reduction in that measured
storage component. Attempt order, tied winner, and identities match. Separate
search tests preserve incumbent, recovery, and historical selected states.
These are weak-reference live-buffer measurements, not RSS, end-to-end solver
memory, production GPU VRAM, or runtime speedup measurements.

The canonical inference inventory decreases **37 → 34 modules** and
**767,700 → 725,861 source bytes** (41,839 fewer bytes; 5.45%). AST counts are
364 → 343 top-level functions, 128 → 120 methods, and 29 → 25 nested functions.
The README now focuses on usage and supported behavior; dated qualification
history is preserved in this document rather than deleted.

CUDA and representative cohort/release-panel qualification remain pending.
No scheduler jobs were launched: the external LSF project runbook is absent,
and the worktree is not yet an immutable committed run source under the
`clipp2-run` contract. No objective or certificate threshold was relaxed to
obtain the CPU parity results.

## Precision and memory contraction (first pass) — 2026-09-09

The reference is `bb726ad3fb3737cca48e06cce66943d5fbba52b4`. This pass narrows
precision support, retains only the best completed multistart fit/context,
omits clipped-slope tensors and masks from likelihood-only grids, and removes
the intermediate `TorchTumorData` wrapper. `PreparedProblem` owns immutable
source and working models, epsilon, and objective identity directly. Promotion
and terminal auditing still rebuild from float64 sources; ordinary runtime
mutations still fail identity checks. No compatibility wrapper remains.

Scoring has one BIC primitive, one Dirichlet mass/uncertainty primitive, and one
final `fixed_partition_dirichlet_score` constructor. Plain-BIC/duplicate numeric
score interfaces are retired, not the BIC contribution. Configuration owns the
unchanged `alpha=1` and assignment weight `0.7`; the score retains nominal
`K*S` degrees of freedom and the positive-depth observed-row count convention.
Score arithmetic uncertainty
and ranking boundaries are preserved, as are the graph, likelihood, scalar
refit modes, raw admission gate, output schemas, and reporting validation.

Validation in `ml1` includes the isolated installed wheel, precision endpoint
and padded-candidate regressions, exact score/uncertainty goldens, and weakref
state-lifetime checks. With 4 or 32 starts, only the incumbent completed-start
dual remains before each next solve. Composite compressed/dense/CPU-fallback
tests also check discarded traceback storage and exact winner-context polishing.
These are CPU lifetime checks, not measured production GPU VRAM.
The full suite passes **508 tests**; Ruff and `git diff --check` also pass.

Pinned float32/float64 CPU comparisons cover ten raw/warm cases and six hybrid
fits: 8–24 mutations, 1/3 regions, CN1–6, balanced CN6, LOH, purity variation,
missing observations, and zero depth. Inputs, priors, pilots, graph/objective
identities, raw results/certificates, selected labels, fixed-refit CCFs, score
uncertainties, posteriors, qualification, and four TSVs match exactly. Four
CNA-positive hybrid fits each have eight `major_cn != minor_cn` positive-depth
rows; their public-refit CNA-only multiplicity F1 also matches. Capture hashes:

- Broader raw/warm and two hybrid checks:
  `4041b281a0e16ddbb3405e6a11d367d5080ebdf21b40b68527d39fe56ab96bbd`.
- Four CNA-positive hybrid checks:
  `52e3bf8dfcf8e1431d45dac757e890d5484ef6ddf7ed332d34d95503082dc7e4`.

For a `128 × 3 × 257 × 6` likelihood grid, CPU dispatch-visible peak live
intermediate storage decreases **14,213,376 → 11,844,864 bytes** in float32 and
**28,424,448 → 23,687,424 bytes** in float64 (about 16.7%); loss arrays match
byte-for-byte. This excludes input storage and opaque operator workspaces and
is not an end-to-end runtime or CUDA memory measurement.

Inference source remains **37 modules**, decreasing **767,700 → 752,294 bytes**
(15,406 fewer bytes, 2.01%). AST definition counts decrease from 364 to 350
top-level functions, 128 to 119 methods, and 29 to 28 nested functions. The
reachability audit removes export-only legacy helpers and test-only forwarding
wrappers after migrating their tests, not public import hooks, documented
writers, or reachable sparse/dense/resource fallbacks. Source accounting
excludes setup, tests, tools, and documentation, as in the reference measure.

These remain bounded synthetic CPU parity checks, not cohort accuracy or CUDA
qualification. Some raw smoke fits remain identically uncertified under their
small budgets; all six hybrid checks have admitted positive-lambda references.
LSF qualification is pending: the external project runbook is currently absent
and surviving historical runners expect obsolete v0.4 interfaces. Do not use
them unchanged or treat these local results as a production release gate.
Version stays **0.5.0**; no output or numerical identity schema is changed.

## Integrity qualification (`bb726ad`) — 2026-09-09

Following the review of `5ca5a1914cffc929949c4d1e22b44432a99c3b9f`, this pass
closes writable-result, mismatched-reporting-input, and selected/raw-reference
summary gaps. It also removes duplicated prepared bounds/hashes and solver
argument forwarding, consolidates preparation/retry configuration, freezes data
once, removes the stored multiplicity specification, and shares NumPy/Torch
candidate arithmetic across scalar, observed, grid, and EM evaluation. The
statistical reductions remain separate. Likelihood-only grids do not compute
posterior derivatives, and warm continuations no longer allocate discarded
copies of their primals. No graph backend or hybrid candidate family is removed.

A pinned comparison captured five tiny CPU-float64 fixtures (CN1, CN2, CN6,
equal CN6, and an independently generated two-region count fixture). The
captured numerical records match **byte for byte**: retained numerical inputs,
candidate support/priors, initialization, pilot, graph weights/hashes, objective
keys, loss/gradient/curvature, raw and warm CCFs/objectives, certificates/stop
reasons, and three hybrid selections' labels/refit CCFs/scores/posteriors/four
TSVs. The two-region fixture's CNA-only multiplicity macro/micro-F1 also matches
(10 eligible rows; a parity check, not a cohort accuracy estimate). Capture
SHA-256: `ce8e7fc88e46e00cbacd9161ad3ecf0eb3133f96029e09741092c84891e5748d`.
These checks do not establish bitwise equivalence on other inputs or devices.

In `ml1`, **437 tests passed** in 26.37 seconds, including the isolated installed
wheel and new result/reporting/copy-integrity regressions. Ruff and
`git diff --check` passed. Validation command:

```bash
env -u PYTHONPATH PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 \
  conda run -n ml1 python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider
```

Inference source remains 37 Python files and decreases from **772,924 to
767,700 bytes** (5,224 fewer bytes, about 0.7%), excluding setup, tests, tools,
and documentation. The principal simplification is fewer independently stored
quantities and forwarding paths, not fewer module files; new integrity checks
and regression tests are retained.

Retained-input fingerprint schema changes from v2 to **v3** because the stored
candidate specification is gone; numerical model, likelihood, box, graph, and
objective-key schemas remain unchanged. Do not reuse cross-revision input
caches or identity-free saved results. Package version remains **0.5.0**, with
no new release tag. CUDA and representative cohort qualification are pending.

## Correction qualification (`5ca5a19`) — 2026-09-09

The correction-only patch following `1a0893d` addresses clipped-likelihood
global certification, explicit warm/start pairing, portable source hashing,
and manifest numerical qualification. The supplied two-mutation plateau
counterexample reproduced at lambdas 0, 0.1, and 100: objective **276.310391**
was falsely marked global despite a feasible objective of **65.016595**.
The corrected path compares the scalar pilot and reaches the better point,
without claiming whole-box global optimality. Tests cover CPU float32 and
float64, both solver routes, clipping endpoints, warm-only calls, and separate
warm/explicit starts. The objective, clipping, box, graph, and gate are unchanged.

In `ml1`, **350 tests passed** in 26.86 seconds, including the existing reference
pipeline checks, independent numerical formulas, portable-path hash checks,
and isolated installed-wheel CPU fit. Ruff and `git diff --check` passed.
Native Windows execution and production CUDA were not tested in this patch.

At this reference commit the prepared-state, data-ownership, and arithmetic
contractions remained separate work. Its corrections alone made no
benchmark-accuracy claim.

## Release 0.5.0 qualification (`1a0893d`) — 2026-09-09

In `ml1` (Python 3.13.2, NumPy 2.2.6, SciPy 1.18.0, Torch 2.9.1), all
**277 checked-in tests passed**, including the isolated wheel fit. Ruff and
`git diff --check` passed. The untouched reference passed its 152 regressions.

Paired CPU-float64 checks against
`cc5a3d1ac28097c2b3005c1c2615930f0ab424de` covered four tiny CN1/CN2/CN6
fixtures. Selected labels, refitted CCFs, Dirichlet scores, multiplicity
posteriors, four TSV schemas, and fixed-lambda objectives matched exactly.
Maximum raw-CCF difference was `3.8e-15`. Kernel, scalar-bound, initialization,
and pipeline reference values are preserved in the tests.

This is numerical equivalence, **not bitwise search equivalence**: generalized
initialization changed pilots by up to `4.2e-13` and adaptive weights by up to
`5.35e-12` in the paired probes. An adaptive graph hash and one recovery trace
changed. New fingerprint schemas invalidate old caches; within-run graph and
objective identities remain strict. CUDA/cohort qualification is pending.

Inference Python source decreased from 45 modules / 860,280 bytes to 36 modules /
759,123 bytes (about 12% fewer bytes). Moving the simulator also removes its
eight modules from the wheel; restoring tests intentionally increases the
maintained repository's test coverage rather than minimizing its file count.
